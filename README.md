# M1_Electricity-Bill-system-UTIL

Electricity consumers are often faced with the problem of inaccuracy and delay in monthly billing due to the drawback in reading pattern and human errors. Thus, it is essential to have an efficient system for such purposes via electronic platform with consideration to proximity. The proposed system automates the conventional process of paying electricity bill by visiting the Electricity Board which is tiresome and time consuming. It is also designed to automate the electricity bill calculation and payment for user convenience. The system is developed with Microsoft Visual Studio using C as the base programming language which can be used to develop websites, web applications and web services. The Microsoft Structured Query Language  server is also used for creating back-end database. The system would be having two logins: the administrative and user login. The administrator can view the user's account details and can add or update the customer's information of consuming units of energy of the current month in their account. The Admin has to feed the system with the electricity usage data into respective users account. The system then calculates the electricity bill for every user and updates the information into their account every month. Users can then view their electricity bill and pay before the month end.
